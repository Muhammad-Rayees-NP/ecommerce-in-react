## Frontend

The frontend of the E-Commerce System is built using React. It handles the user interface, user interactions, and communication with the backend server. The frontend components include:

- **Shopping Cart**: Interface for managing cart items and proceeding to checkout.
- **Checkout Process**: Steps to finalize the purchase, including shipping details and payment.
- **Order Tracking**: Allows users to track their orders and view order history.

## Backend

The backend of the system is implemented using Node.js with Express.js framework. It serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the database, handling requests, processing business logic, and providing data to the frontend. The backend components include:

- **API Endpoints**: Define routes for handling requests related to products, users, carts, orders, etc.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Validates user authentication and authorization for protected routes.
- **Database Operations**: Performs CRUD operations on the database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
- **Payment Integration**: Integrates with payment gateways for processing payments securely.

## Database

The system utilizes a relational or NoSQL database to store and manage data such as user information, product details, cart items, orders, etc. Popular choices include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, depending on the specific requirements and scalability needs of the application.
